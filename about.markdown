My name is Sam Cornish, and I'm a software engineer. I currently write C++/C code for embedded systems in the medical device industry. Some of my CS interests include Distributed Systems, networking with service-oriented architecture, generative art, and hardware emulation. 

In my free time, I'm usually either running, surfing, hiking, gaming, or coding. I consider myself an amateur streamer on twitch, channel [here](https://www.twitch.tv/5cornish).
